## Answer 1
The most interesting part from the first video was when he explained that tiny habits can create big change over time. Like even doing something super small, such as one push-up or drinking one glass of water, can slowly build into a routine. It made habits feel less scary.

## Answer 2
**B = MAP** means *Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and a Prompt come together*. Motivation is how much you want to do it, Ability is how easy it is, and Prompt is the reminder or trigger. If one is missing, the habit won’t happen. So it’s better to make habits easy and give yourself clear reminders.

## Answer 3
Celebrating matters because it helps your brain feel rewarded. Even small celebrations make you feel successful, and that positive feeling helps the habit stick. It’s like training your mind to enjoy completing the habit.

## Answer 4
From the *1% Better* video, I liked the idea that small improvements every day add up. You don’t need huge changes overnight. Just getting a little better daily can lead to big results after weeks or months.

## Answer 5
*Atomic Habits* talks a lot about identity, and I found that really interesting. It says habits are not only about actions but about who you become. Like instead of saying “I want to read,” you start thinking “I am a reader,” and then your habits naturally follow that identity.

## Answer 6
To make a habit easier, *Atomic Habits* suggests reducing effort and starting small. Like if you want to exercise, just start with 2 minutes. Make it simple, remove obstacles, and keep everything ready so starting doesn’t feel like work.

## Answer 7
To make a habit harder, you can add barriers or extra steps. For example, if you want to stop eating junk food, don’t keep it nearby. Make it inconvenient to access, so you don’t do it automatically.

## Answer 8
A habit I want to do more is reading books. To make it easier, I can keep a book near my bed or desk, and start with just 1-2 pages daily. That way it feels simple and not like a big task, and slowly it can become regular.

## Answer 9
A habit I want to reduce is scrolling on my phone too much. To make it harder, I can turn off notifications, keep the phone away while studying, or delete apps that waste time. Adding these small barriers will help me control it more.
