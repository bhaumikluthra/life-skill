You usually enter the Stress quadrant during high challenge situations, like when you are working on a difficult project or engaging in a rigorous physical exercise routine. This usually occurs when you are
testing your limits or working under tight deadlines.

## answer 5
Adhere to a rigid sleep schedule to help fix your biological clock and ensure your bedroom is set to a cool temperature of 18°C. Cut back on caffeine consumption and avoid remaining in bed if you find yourself 
turning and tossing to help solidify a strong connection between the bed and sleep.

neurodegenerative disorders.

## answer 7
Engage in 30 minutes of aerobic exercise three to four times a week. You can also incorporate exercise into your daily activities by taking the stairs, power walking while running errands, or turning household 
chores into mini-workouts.
