## 1. The Feynman Technique
The Feynman Technique is a four-step learning method where you master a complex subject by explaining it in the simplest possible terms, as if you were teaching it to a child.

## 2. Overcoming Self-Doubt in Learning
She began as a "math-phobe" who failed her way through science and math in school, yet she eventually retrained her brain at age 26 to become a professor of engineering. This highlights the idea that our brains are not "fixed" and can be rewired to master difficult technical subjects later in life.

## 3. Focused vs. Diffuse Mode
- **Focused mode** is concentrated attention on a specific task using familiar neural patterns.
- **Diffuse mode** is a relaxed, resting state that allows the brain to make creative, broad connections.

## 4. Breaking Down Skills for Effective Learning
- Break the skill into small parts and learn just enough to self-correct during practice.
- Remove all distractions and commit to at least 20 hours of focused effort to push through the initial frustration barrier.

## 5. Practical Tips for Deep Work
- **Kill Distractions:** Phone on silent, block socials, and track your time.
- **Master Concepts:** Explain it in your own words, code it, and teach it.
- **Work Deeply:** Use deadlines as fuel and communicate blockers early.
