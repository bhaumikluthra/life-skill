## Answer 1
The video on grit basically explains that talent isn't everything. It’s more about having the passion and the "stick-to-it-iveness" to keep chasing long-term goals even when the excitement wears off. It’s treating life like a marathon rather than a short sprint.

## Answer 2
For the Super Mario video, the main takeaway is that you learn way faster when you focus on the end goal and don't beat yourself up over mistakes. If you treat failures like just losing a life in a game, you stay focused on solving the puzzle instead of getting discouraged by the "penalty" of failing.

## Answer 3
An internal locus of control is just the belief that you’re the one driving the bus. The video argues that motivation depends on feeling like you have a choice; if you believe your own hard work and decisions actually shape your future, you’re much more likely to keep pushing than if you feel like a victim of luck.

## Answer 4
To build a growth mindset, you really have to start seeing challenges as chances to get better and embrace the fact that you aren't perfect yet. It’s about valuing the hard work over the results, stopping the constant need for approval, and using the word "yet" whenever you feel stuck so you remember your brain is still growing.

## Answer 5
If you want to take action, try keeping a "failure log" to turn mistakes into lessons and force yourself to find one small thing you can control in every tough situation. Asking for "brutally honest" feedback instead of praise is another great way to shift your focus from looking smart to actually getting better.
