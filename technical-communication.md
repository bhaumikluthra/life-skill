# Firewall

A firewall is a network security system used to monitor and control traffic based on predefined rules. It is available as both hardware and software.

## Firewall Packet Filtering
Firewalls filter packets into the following categories:
- **Accept**: Allows the traffic
- **Reject**: Blocks the traffic with an error message
- **Drop**: Blocks the traffic without any message

## Why Is a Firewall Needed?
There are many threats over the internet that can be risky, such as:
- Unauthorized access to our network
- Leak of sensitive information due to insecure networks
- And many more...

To prevent these risks, we use firewalls. A firewall acts like a security guard that prevents anyone who could jeopardize our security from entering the system. By combining prevention, monitoring, and control, firewalls provide protection against external and internal threats.

## How Does It Work?
1. All data packets entering or leaving the network pass through the firewall.
2. The firewall examines each packet to determine if it is safe.
3. If deemed safe, it is accepted; otherwise, it is considered suspicious.
4. Blocked or unusual traffic is recorded in logs.
5. Setting the default policy to drop or reject is considered best practice to prevent unauthorized access.

## Types of Firewalls 
### Software Firewall
A software firewall is a program that protects a device by monitoring and blocking unauthorized network traffic.
### Hardware Firewall
A hardware firewall is a physical security device that protects a network by filtering and blocking unauthorized internet traffic before it reaches computers.
