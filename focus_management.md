**Answer1-** Deep work is a state of intense concentration on a mentally demanding task, free from distractions. It stretches your mental abilities to their limit, enabling you to produce high-quality results that 
are hard for others to copy. In contrast, "shallow work" consists of tasks like answering emails or going to unproductive meetings that require little mental effort.

**Answer2-** To work deeply, it helps to go beyond relying on willpower and set up a system. Try scheduling distraction breaks at certain times when you can let your mind wander. This approach teaches your brain to 
stay focused during deep work sessions instead of always reaching for your phone for a quick boost.It also helps to create a daily routine. Starting your deep work at the same time and place each day makes it 
easier to begin without overthinking it. At the end of the day, try a shutdown routine to wrap up any unfinished tasks. This helps your mind rest and get ready for the next session.

**Answer3-** If you’re new to this, don’t try to sit for 4–5 hours straight. Just start with one hour. That’s enough. You can slowly increase it once you get used to it.Most people can only do about four hours of 
real deep work in a day anyway. And even that doesn’t happen all at once. It usually comes in 60 to 90 minute blocks before your brain starts feeling tired. Mornings are usually better for this kind of work. 
There are less messages, less people asking for things, and your mind feels a bit more fresh.

**Answer4-** Social media isn’t really built to be a helpful tool. It’s designed to grab your attention and keep it there for as long as possible. Once you start scrolling, it’s hard to stop… and that’s not by 
accident. Using it constantly can slowly break your focus. Your attention gets pulled in different directions all day, and over time it becomes harder to sit still and concentrate on one thing properly.
